My name is Munazza Ilyas. 
I am a 2nd year Full-time MBA student at McCombs School of Business, majoring in analytics and technology. 
I have been very curious about learning new skills and technologies especially relating to manipulating data which I think is very powerful. That is what brings me to this class. I have worked alongside programmers, developers, and data scientist and I feel the need to be comfortable communicating with them by understanding their language and jargons. 
In addition, I enjoy Economics. I have studied various courses in economics including Econometrics, real analysis, macro, and micro. I believe, whatever your field of study may be, it is important to study economics and be able to analyze economics data. 
In my free time, I like to bike, read the news, play with my cat, watch Netflix, and go for long walks. 
I am excited to be part of this class and thoroughly enjoying it! Looking forward to a great semester with you all!
